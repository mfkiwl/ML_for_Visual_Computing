# ML-for-Visual-Computing
## All code are designed by myself and each exercise was implemented from scratch. All data were given by UCL (University College London - Department of Computer Science) as they have different dimensions from IRIS and MNIST.

## FIRST PROJECT: IRIS and MNSIT from Scratch

You will be provided with two subsets for each the dataset, a training subset (XX_train_samples.npy and XX_train_labels.npy) and a validation set (XX_val_samples.npy and XX_val_labels.npy), which include IRIS (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and MNIST (Hand-writing 0~9), respectively. Classes name is that Iris Setosa for label: 0, Iris Versicolour for label: 1, and Iris Virginical for label: 2.

## SECOND PROJECT: Auto Encoder and Image Filtering
The Datasets to be used for this project, can be download from this link: https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&confirm=Dv2h&id=1cRSxlp7RJWoggAaV3clD_MQfPyMkvCCV

(Reminder! : The outputs had some problems, which were "CUDA out of memory". It has GPU problem and my GPU has only 8GB. If you want to run fully my code, then I prefer that your GPU should be larger than 8GB. Thank you.)
